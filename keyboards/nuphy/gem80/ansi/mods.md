# Modifications you can (want) to control :D

in file **config.h**:

```c
#define CAPS_LOCK_LED_SIDE      true
#define CAPS_LOCK_LED_KEY       false
```

So first one enables or disables top left LED to be CAPS_LOCK status indicator, and second one enables or disables CAPS_LOCK key to be CAPS_LOCK status indicator.

You can enable or disable both, or just one of them.

If none is enabled, CAPS_LOCK status will be not indicated at all.
